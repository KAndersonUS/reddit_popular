#reddit_popular

### A basic script for comparing the contents of /r/all and /r/popular (released on Feb 15 2017)

This project was whipped together in a couple of hours to help determine what subreddits, among 
other data points (like domain, author, etc.) are filtered from /r/all and don't appear 
on /r/popular.

Much of this project doesn't follow exact best practices (i.e. separate config files) because it is 
designed to run locally only once. A future build may be created that is more flexible and 
can be configured.
